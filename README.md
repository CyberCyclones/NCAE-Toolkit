## About the Competition
As written on the official [NCAE website](https://www.ncaecybergames.org)

> NCAE Cyber Games is a cyber security competition for college students who have never participated in a competition or hackathon before. Cyber competitions are a great way to build your skills and learn about the industry, but they can be intimidating if youâ€™ve never tried one before. This program aims to make it easy (and fun) for students to see how competitions work and learn with others who are also new.

>NCAE Cyber Games is a combination of capture the flag (CTF) and red versus blue infrastructure competition. As a competitor, you will work with your teammates to defend your systems from the NCAE Cyber Games red team. While the red team will be your opposition on competition day, you will be vying for the top score against other teams. To beat the competition, your team will need to act as a unified force to keep the red team out of your systems and score points in the CTF.
